my shop

When an HR asks, “Tell me about yourself,” they want to understand:

Your background (education or work experience)
Skills relevant to the role
How you fit into the company (professional goals)
Here’s a good structure and sample response tailored to your situation (as you're currently working on web development projects and doing an internship at Codiotic Pvt Ltd):

Sample Answer:

"Hi, my name is Krishna Patidar. I’m currently working as a web developer intern at Codiotic Pvt Ltd, where I’m honing my skills in TypeScript, React, and Tailwind CSS. During my internship, I’ve been involved in developing an inventory management system and shop management projects, focusing on both frontend UI and backend logic separation.

My experience includes working on UI/UX improvements, handling complex forms using Formik, and building reusable components like custom text fields and password fields. I prefer clean code practices and ensuring both user experience and code maintainability are top priorities.

Currently, I’m also passionate about learning full-stack development and enjoy solving challenges related to dynamic UIs and state management. My goal is to grow in roles that align with modern web technologies and contribute meaningfully to team-based projects."

Why this structure works:
Introduction: You introduced yourself, briefly mentioning your current role.
What you do: You highlighted relevant experience and projects, giving insight into your work and skills.
How you align: You touched on your interests and future goals, showing the HR that you want to grow and align with the company’s work.
This structure ensures the HR sees you as confident, goal-oriented, and technically skilled. Adjust the answer based on the role you're applying for, but always highlight your current work and how it’s preparing you for future opportunities.
